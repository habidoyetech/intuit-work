## Getting started
**I created a cloned copy of [Intuit](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html) Account Creation Webpage. The main aim is use this project to learn form element of HTML/CSS.**

I used the browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect the Intuit Signup webpage to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the [web page](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html), inspect its features with browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
